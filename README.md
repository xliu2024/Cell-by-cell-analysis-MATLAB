This file contains MATLAB code for single-cell analysis of flow cytometry data. Cell-by-cell variation based on  receptor abundance is analyzed from PE fluorescence intensity. A total of 5000 cells were randomly pooled from each cell population. Background noise is subtracted on the basis of the signal differences between labeled  (represented by the variable 'pe' in the file) and unlabeled (represented by the variable 'none') cells. A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test is performed  to determine if the distribution for each receptor and EC type is from a common distribution. To quantify cell-to-cell variation in receptor abundance within each EC type, quadratic entropy (QE) is calculated to measure diversity by evaluating the weighted difference between protein levels across cells. The approach divides each cell-by-cell distribution into 500 equally spaced bins and calculates a sum of weighted differences between every two bins based on their average levels and distance.
